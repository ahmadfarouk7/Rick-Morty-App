In this project, I applied the Cubit architecture to fetch data from an API to display characters. The features include:

Search by Name: You can search characters by their name.
Character Filtering: Characters can be filtered by the first letter.
Dynamic AppBar with Sliver: The characterâ€™s name smoothly transitions into the app bar title when the user scrolls upwards.
Hero Animations: Implemented hero animations for smooth transitions between screens for the first time.
